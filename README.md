- 👋 Hi, I’m @DeveloperTinoco
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to use programming to solve the problems of small business owners who can't afford fancy solutions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, QtDesigner, C++ and a few other things too. If you want to know, just ask!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that allow me to help others while improving my programming skills along the way.
- 📫 You can reach me here, by email (esteban.tinoco7@gmail.com) or on Twitter @Darth_TG
